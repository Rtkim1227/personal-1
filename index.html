		<h1> Salutations, Ryan the Chameleon! 
		</h1>
		<p> Ryan Kim is a rising senior at the prestigious high school, Bronx Science who is very active as he plays volleyball for his school team and basketball for his church team. One day during volleyball practice, he saw a chameleon in the gym and chased it in an effort to catch it. But things went wrong as he got too close to it and the chameleon stuck out his slimy toungue and licked Ryan all over the face. Disgusted, he ran to bathroom where he grabbed the door handle but realized it was locked. That wasn't the main problem and he immediately realized he was gray all over. Confused and speechless, he started looking at his surroundings and saw that the bathroom door handle was the only gray object that he had touched. His body started returning his normal skin color before he touched the white walls and became pale white. This was his aha moment. Since then, Kim has been the leading commander in chief of operations in the army as he is greatly gifted in camoflauging into his surroundings without his enemies suspecting a thing. Today, he is also a coder who founded this website which is designed to change colors randomly with the click the button.  </p>
